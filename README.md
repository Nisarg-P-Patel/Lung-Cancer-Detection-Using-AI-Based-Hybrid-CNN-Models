# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-AI-Based-Hybrid-CNN-Models

This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for early-stage lung cancer detection using CT scan images. The system utilizes a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, incorporating image augmentation and pre-processing techniques to enhance performance with a limited dataset. The goal is to assist medical professionals in accurately diagnosing lung cancer without relying on extensive biomedical image datasets.

## Project Abstract

Early-stage cancer detection significantly improves treatment success rates. Lung cancer, being one of the top three cancers globally, requires efficient early detection methods. This project proposes an AI model that predicts lung disease from CT scan images, even with a small dataset. The model employs advanced image augmentation and hybrid CNN architectures to optimize performance and accuracy.
